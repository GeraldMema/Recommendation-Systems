# Recommendation-Systems
Improve the output of proposed algorithms with multiple criteria based on collaborative filtering

ABSTRACT

There is an extensive class of Web applications concerning the production of recommendations to users for resources, 
items and services which are available in the web. Such applications are called recommendation systems. Recommendation systems 
use a number of different approaches, the most popular being content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. 
This thesis is an extension of G. Bourtsoukliâ€™s thesis (2014), which implemented a rating prediction algorithm to evaluate 
items according to multiple criteria, in order to recommend these items to the users according to their preferences. 
This thesis focuses on two aspects to improve the results of the algorithm. First, a modification of the method of linear 
regression which is used to calculate the weights assigned by the users to each criterion is proposed in order to improve its 
results and overcome its limitations. Furthermore, the problem of handling a larger number of users is faced by using an 
algorithm which finds approximate nearest neighbors by LSH (locality sensitive hashing). LSH achieves the reduction of 
the dimensions of the problem and improves time and space complexity. Last but not least, the modified algorithm is evaluated and 
compared with regard to its effectiveness and performance with two other popular algorithms, the Decomposing Multi Criteria and 
Weighted Slope One, as well as the initial algorithm.
